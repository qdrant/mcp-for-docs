# MCP for Qdrant Documentation

The idea is to create a PoC for curated documentation MCP server based on `mcp-server-qdrant`.

## Motivation

Default `mcp-server-qdrant` is too general and expects you to put data into it.
But one of the main use-cases for MCP is to provide LLMs with latest and most accurate documentation.

This project should serve as an example of how you can build ready-to-use MCP server for a specific package documentation.
